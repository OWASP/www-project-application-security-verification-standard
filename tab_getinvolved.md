# Volunteer for the ASVS

## Building the standard

We are always looking for people to help out with building the standards and discussing what should be in there.

You can find information on contributing to the standard in the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Helping in other ways

We are looking for volunteers to help with the following tasks. We are working on the ASVS all year around and you should expect to have to spend a few hours a week working on your tasks on average. Some of the tasks may be more intensive such as building scripts or GitHub actions.

If any of these roles sound like a good fit for you, please get in touch! Students and non-tech people are welcome to apply, especially folks in the community who are trying to get into the security space but don't know how, as being involved in an OWASP project like this can provide valuable experience.

The latest list of roles is here:
