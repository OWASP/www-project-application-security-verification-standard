# OWASP ASVS Community Meetup 2024

We held a community meetup for the ASVS project as part of Global AppSec Lisbon on 27th June 2024!

Jim Manico gave the opening keynote to reintroduce the ASVS and the background behind the project and we had some [other great talks](#full-agenda) as well!

There was also an update on the current status of the standard and time allocated to work on the upcoming version 5.0.

You can see full details in the blog post we published about it: <https://owasp.org/blog/2024/07/03/asvs-community-meetup.html>

Additionally, we would love to get more community members involved in the ASVS and other than working on the standard we also have information about other volunteering opportunities to help develop and promote the project! See the "[Get Involved](https://appsecg.host/asvsgetinvolved)" tab above!.
