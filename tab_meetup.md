# OWASP ASVS Community Meetup 2024

We are excited to announce that we will be holding a community meetup for the ASVS project as part of Global AppSec Lisbon on 27th June 2024 in room 1.13 of the conference venue!

We are particularly excited that Jim Manico will be giving the opening keynote to reintroduce the ASVS and the background behind the project.

There will also be an update on the current status of the standard and time allocated to work on the upcoming version 5.0. Additionally, we would love to get more community members involved in the ASVS and other than working on the standard we will also have information about other volunteering opportunities to help develop and promote the project!

Follow us on social media to ensure you don't miss further information about the agenda which we will be releasing in due course:
